" Loading plugins
" ===============

" We want to turn off the default filetype controls for now because the way
" that vim caches filetype rules at runtime interferes with the way that vundle
" alters the runtime environment. We will change this back later:
set nocompatible
filetype off

" Next, we'll need to adjust vim's runtime path to include the vundle
" location we cloned from GitHub:
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/
" After that, we will call the vundle initialization function:
call vundle#rc()
"
" For GitHub repos, you specify plugins using the
" 'user/repository' format.

" This is the Vundle package, which can be found on GitHub:
Plugin 'gmarik/vundle'

" This is syntax highlighting for Scala:
Plugin 'derekwyatt/vim-scala'

" This is syntax highlightinh for Jade templates:
Plugin 'digitaltoad/vim-jade'

" This is syntax highlighting for Puppet
Plugin 'rodjek/vim-puppet'


" To get plugins from Vim Scripts, you can reference the plugin
" by name as it appears on the site, e.g.
"Plugin 'Buffergator'


" Now we can turn our filetype functionality back on
filetype plugin indent on


" Appearance
" ==========

" Use dark colorscheme:
colorscheme torte

" Change some colors of that scheme:
highlight LineNr ctermfg=darkgrey guifg=darkgrey
highlight Folded guifg=black

" Set default font:
set guifont="DejaVu Sans Mono 8"


" Ideosyncracies
" ==============

" Always set working dir according to the current file for easy switching
autocmd BufEnter * cd %:p:h

" Enable Unicode
if has("multi_byte")
    set encoding=utf-8
    " Detect encodings in this order:
    " 1) Unicode with Byte Order Mark (8/16/32 Bit), if that fails, try..
    " 2) UTF-8 (without BOM), if that fails, try..
    " 3) ISO-8859-15 = latin9 ~= ISO-8859-1/latin1 with Euro sign
    set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,iso-8859-15
    "language messages en   " Umlauts are not displayed correctly otherwise
endif

" I don't like leaving invisible litter, so I make it visible
" (This has to come after the unicode stuff)
